     WaniKani Mobile for Android
=======================================
(formerly known as "Wanikani Notifier")

WaniKani (http://www.wanikani.com) is a kanji learning web app that
uses radical, mnemonics, and SRS (Spaced Repetition Software).

This (unofficial) app for Android tailors WaniKani to Android devices:
- Notify when new reviews (and optionally lessons) become available
- Integrated reviews and lessons, with small embedded keyboard to fix possible
  incompatibilities between WK and android browser
- SRS distribution plots and progress plots (data can be exported)
- Dashboard showing level progression and study queue
- Item browser

You can download the binary package from Google Play:

There are many ways you can contribute:
- Suggest new features you'd like to be added: the most popular features in this app
  come from Wanikaners' suggestions
- Report any bugs you encounter. Please do! There's a huge number of Android devices, 
  combined with different Android OS versions, hardware capabilities and screen sizes.
  Most issues don't get fixed simply because I'm not aware of them.
- If the app crashes or stops being resposive, and Android offers sending a bug report,
  please accept. All I receive is a stack trace and your message. I don't receive
  any personal information about you. If possible, please contact me using one of 
  the methods below: usually I need some more info to fix it properly.  
- Of course any code contribution is well accepted. If you have any doubts, feel free
  to ask.
 
You can interact with me either using:
- GitHub
- Wanikani http://www.wanikani.com/chat/api-and-third-party-apps/2225
- Or send me an email (the address is on the Google play app page)

Of course you are welcome to mention a bug or an issue directly on the reviews page of 
Google play, but please also use one of the methods above to contact me. Though I try to 
give useful hints, the interaction on that page is clumsy and often I simply can't 
fix the app, because I can't gather enough information.

    Have fun
